# Graph-Visualiser
Android application to identify written coordinates of points of a graph on paper and overlay a graph fitting those points. 

Expected flow of code:

1. Image capture
2. Prompt users to manually select the boundaries of xy-axes on image and define their ranges
3. ML-Kit to identify bounding boxes
4. Image binarisation (maybe invert colours for better results) for every isoloated coordinate image to remove noise
5. Pass through own model to recognise numbers and special characters (Ï€, e)
6. Form query for wolfram alpha using keyword "fit"
7. Display results overlaid on image capture, scaled to fit the boundaries
8. Profit???

Use cloud vision since that provides support for bounding box of symbols: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml/android/recognize-text
Probably use it to identify bounding boxes and then apply my model to it. Check whether numbers are identified as symbols or have to use block's bounding box and separate manually to identify
